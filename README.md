# Cornerstone: Licenses

## Dependencies
- Ox lib
- Ox Target
- Ox Inventory
- Qbox

A simple script to setup grant license for Qbox when no police are online. This script will only grant the player a license, they will still need to purchase the hard copy at a City Hall or some other script.

This script uses AL MDT script to check if the player is allowed to have a weapon license. The server/MDT_Check.lua file can be modified if you want to check for a player to get a valid license. 

## Support

There is no support for this script. It was written for use with Ox inventory on a QBox server and will not be updated to support other inventories of frameworks. You are free to make those changes yourself. 

It's crap code, created to serve a singular purpose.
